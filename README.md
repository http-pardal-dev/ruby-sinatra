An HTTP server built with Ruby and Sinatra, providing a JSON API with three resources. Each resource focuses on a different part of HTTP.

> **Note:** This API has no authentication. Every route is open and requires no login, token, or permissions. The server listens only on `127.0.0.1`. Do not expose it on `0.0.0.0` or a public address.

## Getting started

Local (Ruby >= 3.2, see `.ruby-version`):

```sh
bundle install
cp .env.example .env                       # optional; development is the default
bundle exec rake db:migrate                # create the SQLite database
bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb         # http://127.0.0.1:9292
```

Tests and lint:

```sh
APP_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate   # once, prepares storage/test.sqlite3
bundle exec rspec                          # the suite (not `rake spec`: it runs nothing)
bundle exec rake lint                      # RuboCop
```

Docker (same commands as the CI):

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose up dev                      # migrate + server
docker compose run --rm test               # migrate + suite
```

## Routes

### Health

| Method | Path | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/` | Health check — `{ service, status: "ok" }` |

### Users — CRUD & Fundamentals

| Method | Path | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/users` | Lists all users |
| `GET` | `/users/:id` | Finds a user by id |
| `POST` | `/users` | Creates a user → `201` + `Location: /users/:id` |
| `PUT` | `/users/:id` | Replaces a user (requires `name`, `email`, `role`) |
| `PATCH` | `/users/:id` | Partially updates a user |
| `DELETE` | `/users/:id` | Removes a user → `204` |

### Products — Queries

| Method | Path | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/products` | Lists products — filters (`category`, `min_price`, `max_price`), sorting (`sort=name`/`price`, `-` = desc), pagination (`page`, `limit`) |
| `GET` | `/products/:id` | Finds a product by id |
| `POST` | `/products` | Creates a product → `201` + `Location: /products/:id` |
| `PATCH` | `/products/:id` | Partially updates a product |

### Payments — Lifecycle

| Method | Path | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/payments` | Creates a `pending` payment → `201` + `Location: /payments/:id` |
| `GET` | `/payments` | Lists payments — optional filter `?status=pending|paid|cancelled` |
| `GET` | `/payments/:id` | Finds a payment by id |
| `POST` | `/payments/:id/confirm` | `pending` → `paid` (`409` otherwise) |
| `POST` | `/payments/:id/cancel` | `pending` → `cancelled` (`409` otherwise) |

Details (params, bodies, status codes): see `docs/` and `contract/openapi.yml`.
